        <h2>The early days</h2>
        <p>I grew up in St. Louis, MO and was always an active child who enjoyed sports and getting dirty. It was until I was 10 that I became fascinated with computers. The year was 1995 and there was a movie I saw that just put a smile on my face and got my brain wanting to be creative and think outside the box. That movie was Toy Story. I had no idea what went into making this 3D modeling and animated film. All I knew is that it was made by computers and I wanted to know more, so I started looking into how I could accomplish that. My first step was in middle school when I taught myself <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html" target="_blank">Adobe Photoshop</a> to edit images and create GIFs. It wasn't until High School that I really started to break out into the computer world (plus it was around 4 years later so computers advanced so much already). During High School I learned about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_FrontPage" target="_blank">Microsoft Front Page</a> and started my love for the internet and websites. At the same time I learned about Adobe Illustrator and Premiere to get that much more of an understanding of Video Editing and Vector based designs. By the end of High School I took every computer related class possible, 8 in total, that taught me so much about how movies were made, how to edit photos, and the beginnings of how to make websites. In the midst of taking all of these computer glasses and totally geeking out, I also played 6 sports in highschool. I play Baseball, Basketball, Soccer, Volleyball, Cross Country, Track, and I played inline hockey outside of school and continue to play today in recreational leagues. This is a large part of me that I feel makes me unique.</p>
        <h2>College years</h2>
        <p>I ended up staying in state and went to the University of Missouri. There I learned about 3D modeling, Adobe After Effects, and another video editing program, Avid HD. This was when I felt like my dream of one day being a part of making a movie or 3D animated film could really be a possibilty. I found myself going for a major in Computer Science at first since an IT degree wasn't established yet. This was my first introduction to programming languages. I started off on Visual Basic and then was taught Java. I never really grasped them that well and didn't have a strong foundation. That being said, I have come to appreciate programming and even find myself enjoying it more and more as I get better with it.</p>
        <p>Just like in High School I made sure to still be active and play recreational sports in college as well. They included, Softball, Ultimate Frisbee, Flag Football, and some Basketball (not my strongest sport). And oh, as far as classes go, I also took a Video Game design course so I guess you could say my college years was similar to High School in that I wanted to try out everything. Quick fact: My favorite college class was Classical Mythology where I learned all about Greek Mythology.</p>
        <h2>The real world</h2>
        <p>After college I moved out to Los Angeles right away knowing that it's where I wanted to be and see my future taking me. After about 3 months I had found my first job as a personal assistant. They say you have to start somewhere and for me, this was a big deal being my first job right out of school. It didn't last quite a year after which I moved on to a company called CyberDefender. This was a company that sold 24/7 tech support and my job had me fixing upwards of 10-15 computers a day whilst also taking 40 incoming phone calls. The biggest thing I learned from this job, not including how to support computers and fix viruses, was how customer support is not for me but I can appreciate and respect the people that do it.</p>
        <p>My next job was for a company called <a href="www.bscmanage.com" target="_blank">BSC Management</a> I held this job for almost 5 years and was my first long-term position in Los Angeles. I learned so much on the job such as Wordpress, PHP, some Javascript and Jqeury/AJAX, as well as some MySQL and Dreamweaver. This was the time I grew to enjoy programming more than I realized. I was more interested in Web Development over Software Development and that is still the case today.</p>
        <p>My most recent job was at UCLA. I held that job for a little over 3 years before being caught in a RIF (reduction in force). This was my most challenging job yet based on the work that was given to me outside of the regular work. I was exposed to Python, Linux, and learned ServiceNow in order to work with our ticketing system. My biggest project was that of the Intranet site I created for the Pathology department. It was around a 3 1/2 month long project where I wrote a multi-page website in collaboration with 8 other colleagues. This was great experience for improving my web development skill as well as my people skills by being the project manager.</p>
        <h2>Where I am today</h2>
        <p>Once it was announced that I was being laid off I decided to start to focus on my Web Development skills and work on changing career paths. I am networking with like-minded developers and hard at work finding a new start in Web Development. This includes taking online courses, going through tutorials, and events with other developers. If there is one thing I have learned while being in LA, it is that networking is the most important skill to have. I am excited to find out what the future will bring.</p>
