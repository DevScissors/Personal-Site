        <h2>The early days</h2>
        <p>I grew up in St. Louis, MO and was always an active child who enjoyed sports and getting dirty. Around age ten I became fascinated with computers. The year was 1995. I saw a movie that just put a smile on my face and got my brain wanting to be creative and think outside the box. That movie was Toy Story. </p>
        <p>I had no idea what went into making this 3D modeling and animated film. All I knew was that it was made by computers and I wanted to know more. So, I started looking into how I could accomplish that. My first step was in middle school when I taught myself <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html" target="_blank">Adobe Photoshop</a> to edit images and create GIFs. to edit images and create GIFs. It wasn't until High School that I really started to break out into the computer world. By that time, with computers and software advancing so rapidly, more courses were being offered in high school. That is when I learned about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_FrontPage" target="_blank">Microsoft Front Page</a> and started my love for the internet and websites. </p>
        <p>During that same time, I learned about Adobe Illustrator and Premiere to get that much more of an understanding of Video Editing and Vector based designs. By the end of High School, I took every computer related class possible, 8 in total, that taught me so much about how movies were made, how to edit photos, and the beginnings of how to make websites.</p>

        <h2>College days</h2>
        <p>I ended up staying in state and went to the University of Missouri. There I learned about 3D modeling, Adobe After Effects, and another video editing program, Avid HD. This was when I felt like my dream of one day being a part of making a movie or 3D animated film could really be a possibility. </p>
        <p>I found myself going for a major in Computer Science at first since an IT degree wasn't established yet. This was my first introduction to programming languages. They were not offered at my high school. I started off on Visual Basic and then was taught Java. I never really grasped them that well and didn't have a strong foundation. That being said, I have come to appreciate programming and even find myself enjoying it more and more as I get better with it.</p>
        <p>Just like in High School, I made sure to stay active and played recreational sports in college as well. They included, Softball, Ultimate Frisbee, Flag Football, and some Basketball (not my strongest sport). And oh, as far as classes go, I also took a Video Game design course, so I guess you could say my college years were like High School in that I wanted to try out everything.</p> 
        <h3>Quick facts:</h3> 
        <ul>
            <li>My favorite college class was Classical Mythology where I learned all about Greek Mythology.</li>
            <li>I love Pyschology and ended up taking enough classes to get a minor in it.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The real world</h2>
        <p>After college I moved out to Los Angeles knowing that it's where I wanted to be and see my future taking me. After about 3 months I had found my first job as a personal assistant. They say you have to start somewhere. For me this was a big deal since it was my first job right out of school.</p>
        <p>Around ten months later I found a better job at a company called CyberDefender. This was a company that sold 24/7 tech support. My job had me fixing upwards of 10-15 computers a day (remotely) whilst also taking 40 incoming phone calls. The biggest thing I learned from this job, not including how to support computers and fix viruses, was how to handle customer support. I learned how to deal with the irate customers as well as appreciating the grateful customers.</p>
        <p>My next job was for a company called <a href="www.bscmanage.com" target="_blank">BSC Management</a>. I held this job for almost 5 years. It was my first long-term position in Los Angeles. I learned so much on the job such as Wordpress, PHP, some Javascript, and Jqeury/AJAX, as well as some MySQL and Dreamweaver. This was the time I grew to enjoy programming more than I realized. I was more interested in Web Development over Software Development and that is still the case today.</p>
        <p>My most recent job was at UCLA. This was my most challenging job yet based on the work that was given to me outside of the regular work. I was exposed to Python, Linux, and learned ServiceNow so I could work with our ticketing system. My biggest project was that of the Intranet site I created for the Pathology department. It was around a 3 1/2 month long project where I wrote a multi-page website in collaboration with eight other colleagues. This was a great experience for improving my web development skill as well as my people skills by being the project manager.</p>
        <h2>Where I am today</h2>
        <p>Lately I decided to start to improving my Web Development skills and work on changing career paths. I am networking with like-minded developers and hard at work finding a new start in Web Development. This includes taking online courses, going through tutorials, and events with other developers. If there is one thing I have learned while being in LA, it is that networking is the most important skill to have. I am excited to find out what the future will bring.</p>
